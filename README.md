### Overview

This is my final project for Flatiron. Cryptid Tracker allows you to keep track of your local cryptid sightings, from the smallest light in the night sky to the hugest beast in the woods. Each cryptid has their own list of individual sightings, which can always be deleted if you find out that weird creature was a hoax, after all.
